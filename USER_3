Who went poking around his gas heater,
Touched a leak with his light;
He blew out of sightâ€”
And, as everyone who knows anything about poetry can tell you, he also ruined the meter.

An escalator can never break: it can only become stairs. You should
never see an Escalator Temporarily Out Of Order sign, just Escalator
Temporarily Stairs. Sorry for the convenience.
