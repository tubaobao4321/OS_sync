Reminder: always test your code!

A forgetful old gasman named Dieter,
Who went poking around his gas heater,
Touched a leak with his light;
He blew out of sightâ€”
And, as everyone who knows anything about poetry can tell you, he also ruined the meter.

There was a young lady named Bright
who traveled much faster than light.
She set out one day
in a relative way,
and came back the previous night.

Not all those who wander are lost
